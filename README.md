## Technical Overview
TreeTrash implements a multi-model, multi-modal AI pipeline for real-time waste analysis and environmental impact assessment. Our system architecture combines computer vision, large language models, and vector search capabilities to create a comprehensive waste management solution.

## Core Architecture

### Computer Vision Pipeline
- Primary Vision Model: Leveraged YOLOv8 for real-time object detection, fine-tuned on custom labeled dataset
- Frame Processing: Utilizes OpenCV for image preprocessing, including noise reduction and contrast enhancement
- Temporal Analysis: Implements a sliding window to track objects across multiple frames, enabling detection of newly added items

### AI Model Integration
- LLM: GPT-4o: for waste classification and initial analysis
- Secondary Models:
  - Perplexity AI for environmental impact research
  - GPT-4o-mini for structured data transformation and report generation
  - Gemini Pro as a VLM to post-process Vespa.ai RAG outputs
- Custom Prompt Engineering: Developed specialized prompts to improve classification accuracy

### RAG Implementation
